    <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <p>From the <strong>Notes</strong> page, you can search for notes directly based on their content. You don't have to know who or
      what the notes linked to. Once you've found the note you searched for, you can click on the Edit icon next to that
      row to edit the note's content. You can also delete the note outright by clicking on the Delete icon next to that row.
      You may not change who or what the note is linked to from this screen. To do that, you must look up the individual,
      family or other entity that the note is linked to and do it from there. The IDs of those entities are displayed on
      the right side of each note row.</p>

    <h4>What's New</h4>
    <p>Any text entered on this tab will be displayed at the top of the <strong>What's New</strong> page in the public area.
      Use this feature if you would like to provide your visitors with a general site update or other timely information. Click on the <strong>Test</strong> link to display the
      What's New page with your message at the top.</p>

    <h4>Most Wanted</h4>
    <p>The Most Wanted tab allows you to add elusive people and mystery photos to a <strong>Most Wanted</strong> page on your site, in hopes of getting more publicity for the
      things that are giving you the most trouble. See the <a href="mostwanted_help.php">Help: Most Wanted</a> link for more information on how to build your Most Wanted page.</p>
